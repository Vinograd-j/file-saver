## File Saver
#### This small project will allow you to sort your music/videos/archives into folders. You specify a folder (for example, downloads) and when files go into it, they will immediately be redirected to another directory. This will help you if you download files from the Internet and do not want to select a folder, but at the same time ensure that the files end up in the right place.
